# Living in the Post-Dobbs Era: The Impact of Travel Burdens on a Shift Toward Self-Managed Abortions in the United States
This repository contains the complete code for my Master's dissertation at the London School of Economics, titled 
*Living in the Post-Dobbs Era: The Impact of Travel Burdens on a Shift Toward Self-Managed Abortions in the United States.* 
I present two main results in this paper. The first is a two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences design that estimates 
the effect of increased travel distance to the nearest abortion provider on clinical abortion and birth counts. The second 
is an interactive Shiny mapping application that shows driving routes from various counties across the U.S. to the nearest 
abortion provider, for the years 2015 to 2023 which encompasses both pre- and post-Dobbs eras. The interactive map leverages 
this paper's estimation of self-managed abortion incidences to show how increased driving distances increase their 
estimated prevalence. The interactive map can be accessed at celinepapageorgiou.shinyapps.io/abortionmappingapp.
